Nevertheless Shapur has to find weaknesses in the Roman army to defeat them. So he gives the army a weakness number.

In Shapur's opinion the weakness of an army is equal to the number of triplets i, j, k such that i < j < k and ai > aj > ak where ax is the power of man standing at position x. The Roman army has one special trait — powers of all the people in it are distinct.
